- Report on the condition of various office properties
- Upload photos when repairs are needed
- Submit data to n8n for AI processing
- Receive automated email summary reports

## 📚 Documentation

For detailed planning information, see **[PROJECT_PLAN.md](./PROJECT_PLAN.md)**

The project plan includes:
- Technology stack and architecture
- Component structure and design
- Form fields and validation rules
- API integration specifications
- UI/UX design guidelines
- Security considerations
- Testing strategy
- Implementation phases

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm, yarn, or pnpm package manager

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   
   Copy the environment template file:
   ```bash
   cp env.template .env.local
   ```
   
   Edit `.env.local` and add your n8n webhook configuration:
   ```env
   N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/office-health-checkup
   N8N_WEBHOOK_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```
   
   **Note:** For local testing without n8n, you can leave these empty. The form will still work but submissions will fail (which is expected for testing the UI).

3. **Run development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🐳 Docker

You can run the app in a container on your Ubuntu server.

### Build image

```bash
docker build -t office-health-checkup .
```

### Run container

```bash
docker run -d \

  --env-file .env.local \
  office-health-checkup
```

## 🧪 Testing Locally

1. **Test the form UI:**
   - Fill out the form with different property conditions
   - Upload photos to test the image upload functionality
   - Test form validation by submitting without required fields

2. **Test without n8n webhook:**
   - The form will work but submissions will show an error (expected)
   - This allows you to test the UI and form validation

3. **Test with n8n webhook:**
   - Set up your n8n webhook URL in `.env.local`
   - Submit the form and verify data is sent correctly
   - Check your n8n workflow receives the data
